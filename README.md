# ColourInvertMagnetism
A series of vague concepts I'm attempting to realise in Unity for potential future implementation. The player passes through a doorway, a blanket shader is applied to the scene and a series of Meshrenderers become enabled. Interacting with these Meshrenderers then impacts the scene as it appears on the other side of the doorway.
